# PDF Splitter
This will split a PDF file into multiple smaller PDF files based on a regular expression search.

## How to Use
Build and run the program. Give the path to your PDF. Put in a regular expression. You can also just treat this as a string search. Click generate and the files will be output to the same folder as the source PDF.
